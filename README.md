# Real-Time-Object-Tracking-By-Color
This project enables real-time detection and tracking of objects of a chosen color using a webcam feed. By leveraging the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space, this implementation provides robust color filtering and bounding box visualization for effective object tracking.
